## Armstrong Numbers

- Armstrong numbers (also known as Narcissistic numbers) are numbers that are equal to the sum of their own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
- In other words, an Armstrong number is a number that, when you separate its digits and raise each one to the power of the total number of digits, the resulting sum equals the original number.

### Examples:

**Three-digit number:**

The number 153 is an Armstrong number because:

$$
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
$$

**Four-digit number:**

The number 9474 is also an Armstrong number because:

$$
9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474
$$

### Key Points:

1. **Number of Digits:** The power each digit is raised to is equal to the number of digits in the number.
2. **Other Examples:** Smaller numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are also Armstrong numbers because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself.

These numbers are often interesting in mathematics and programming because of their unique properties.

## Problem Statement
